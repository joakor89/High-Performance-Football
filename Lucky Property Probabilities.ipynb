Despite this calculated expectation, Real Madrid has managed to secure 5 Champions League titles in the last 9 general presentations of this competition.\nOf course, here is the translated and enhanced version of the sentence:\n\nAt the time of conducting this Straetegy & Intelligence analysis using Data Science tools, Real Madrid had won 5 European Cups in the last 10 tournaments. As such, the parameters of the formula need to be updated. Feel free to take the data and do the calculations yourselves for future tournaments. The expected rate of victory = 10/32=0.3125\n\nHere, it's pivotal to examine the disparity between the anticipated victories and the victories that were actually obtained. The pronounced difference indicates a dynamic that extends beyond mere chance. Simply attributing this to luck doesn't account for the consistent performance exhibited by Real Madrid Football Club in these competitions. Their success can be deconstructed and analyzed more accurately through data science methodologies, revealing the complex interplay of skill, strategy, and yes, a degree of fortuity, that contributes to their winning streaks. This approach allows us to move from general speculation to more substantiated, data-driven insights.\n\nObserve that for a probability (P), we have:\nP = (9/5)*(1/32)^5*(31/32)^4\n\n   - The last nine editions with five won by Real Madrid.\n   - The same probability using the binomial distribution that Real Madrid and the rest of the teams have to win, raised by the times this team managed to conquer the cup and title as champion.\n   - Also consider the times Real Madrid competed for the title but failed in their attempts. Therefore, consider all the teams minus Real Madrid, raised to the number of times they lost the competition.\n\nThus, through the application of probability and data science, we can begin to parameterize luck. This is not only observed in the field of mathematical sciences but also in factors that often go unnoticed, such as attitude, cooperation, influence, strategic thinking, game theory, psychology, among others, within high-performance teams.","block_group":"894408644c244db58f12bdd792afad70"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"formattedRanges":[],"cell_id":"07beeaa3c6bb463e949945800eb3e524","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h3"},"source":"### The Following Binomial Distribution formula to be used is:","block_group":"07beeaa3c6bb463e949945800eb3e524"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"92c0f061f91d47e9a910136f7c55cbc2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"\n\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} * p^{k} * (1-p)^{n-k}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $P(X=k)$ is the probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials.\n- $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways we can get exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials.\n- $p$ is the probability of success in a single trial (in this case, the probability of Real Madrid winning a match).\n- $n$ is the total number of trials (in this case, the number of matches played by Real Madrid).\n- $k$ is the number of successes (in this case, the number of matches won by Real Madrid).\n","block_group":"92c0f061f91d47e9a910136f7c55cbc2"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"execution_start":1689017868115,"execution_millis":935,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"a987ae307a9947cc9cfc3222f912c6f3","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Import the necessary library\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\n# Initialize the parameters of the problem\nmatches_played = 9  # number of matches played by Real Madrid\nvictories = 5  # number of matches won\nteams = 32  # total number of teams in the competition\nprob_victory = 1 / teams  # probability of Real Madrid winning a match\n\n# We use the formula of the binomial distribution to calculate the probability\n# of Real Madrid winning exactly 'victories' matches in 'matches_played' attempts,\n# assuming that the probability of winning an individual match is 'prob_victory'\nprob = binom.pmf(victories, matches_played, prob_victory)\n\nprint(f\"The probability that Real Madrid wins exactly {victories} out of {matches_played} matches is {prob}\")\n","block_group":"a987ae307a9947cc9cfc3222f912c6f3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"The probability that Real Madrid wins exactly 5 out of 9 matches is 3.3072537348743944e-06\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"formattedRanges":[],"cell_id":"d08b1c2bc7bd471385599aa51e6582cb","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-bullet"},"source":"- The `binom.pmf` function takes three arguments: the number of \"successes\" (in this case, Real Madrid's wins), the number of trials (the matches played), and the probability of success in a single trial (the probability of Real Madrid winning a match).","block_group":"d08b1c2bc7bd471385599aa51e6582cb"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"formattedRanges":[],"cell_id":"0943f021ecf9431ba6b089b125a43c53","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-bullet"},"source":"- The result of this calculation is the probability of Real Madrid winning exactly `victories` matches in `matches_played` attempts, given the `prob_victory` probability of winning a single match.
